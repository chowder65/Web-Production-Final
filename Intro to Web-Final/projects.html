                <h3>Flow-Clone</h3>
                <p>Flow is a study application that has been developed on Apple based softwares. It blocks certain applications and has a timer for a studying technique called Pomadoro.
                Me and a colleague have been working on making a version that can be used on windows computers and possibly any type of phone.
                It is still in the early stages of development but we are making progress.
                It is a Electron.js based web application.

                <h3>Console Chess</h3>
                <p>My console chess application was a scool final that allowed me to push myself and my understanding of how it is to use OOP principles and take a deeper dive into Logical thinking
                    It is a console based application that allows you to play chess with another person.
                    It was written in Java and is a simple application that I am proud of.

                <h3>Portfolio</h3>
                <p>This portfolio is a project that I have been working on for a while now. It is a simple website that I have been using to learn and practice my web development skills.
                    That I could possibly look to develop into a more complex website in the future. And possible use it as a base for a personal website that I can change the tech stack on to learn new frameworks and languages.
                    The current tech stack
